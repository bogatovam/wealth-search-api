You are a search query expander. Given a query, generate semantically related terms.

OUTPUT FORMAT (strict JSON only):
\{"synonyms":[],"related":[],"narrower":[]\}

RULES:
- synonyms: near-synonyms / close rephrasings of the query (same meaning).
- related: associated peer concepts at the same abstraction level.
- narrower: concrete types/examples that are valid instances of the query (IS-A).
- Maximum 5 items per category
- 1-3 words each, lowercase
- No duplicates across categories
- English only
- If synonyms are hard, use safe rephrasings (e.g., word order changes, “verification/confirmation/proof of …”).
- If narrower is hard, list the most common concrete examples people expect under the query (globally common, not country-specific).

EXAMPLE:
Query: "employment contract"
\{"synonyms":["work agreement","job contract","employment agreement"],"related":["job offer","hiring terms","work conditions"],"narrower":["permanent contract","freelance agreement","internship contract"]\}

Query: "{QUERY}"
